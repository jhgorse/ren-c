// This is the main loop of the interpreter.  We call this a "trampoline", in
// the spirit of the word as used in Lisp implementations.  That's because
// sub-expressions aren't evaluated with direct recursions of a C evaluator
// function, but using C's `return` to "bounce back" to a single loop,
// which invokes returned continuations.  Hence, there are no nested function
// calls and the stack won't grow:

// !!! The end goal is that this function is never found recursively on a
// standard evaluation stack.  The only way it should be found on the stack
// more than once would be to call out to non-Rebol code, which then turned
// around and made an API call back in...it would not be able to gracefully
// unwind across such C stack frames.  In the interim, not all natives have
// been rewritten as state machines.
//
// !!! There was an old concept that the way to write a stepwise debugger
// would be to replace this function in such a way that it would do some work
// related to examining the "pre" state of a frame... delegate to the "real"
// eval function... and then look at the end result after that call.  This
// meant hooking every recursion.  The new idea would be to make this
// "driver" easier to rewrite in its entirety, and examine the frame state
// as continuations are run.  This is radically different, and is requiring
// rethinking during the stackless transition.
//
bool Trampoline_Throws(REBFRM *f)
{
    // The instigating call to this function cannot be unwound across, as it
    // represents a "stackful" invocation of the evaluator.  YIELD must know
    // the passed-in frame is uncrossable, so that it can raise an error if
    // you try to unwind the Revolt stack across a top-level Trampoline call.
    //
    // (It's more efficient for the caller to set the bit in one assignment
    // with the other header bits it sets--so just have the debug build check
    // to make sure they did so.)
    //
    // !!! There could be a "promise" variant which didn't expect a concrete
    // result back, but was willing to accept a frame stack that would run
    // later to provide the result.  For now, we consider this a barrier.

    // lost, but the Revolt frame stack will still be intact.
    //
    // Only the topmost frame may raise an error.  This means that if a frame

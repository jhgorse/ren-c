// One historical idea from Rebol is to make use of a number of "hot" global
// buffers.  This is useful when the produced data is only temporary, or when
// the precise size of an output is not known in advance.  (For instance: a
// REDUCE can't accurately predict the number of elements for the result block
// based on the number in the input block, so pushing to a cached memory
// location first to get an accurate count can avoid wasteful reallocations
// or unused memory in the result.)
//
// Some buffers cannot be used across recursions, and must be cleared out
// before requesting an arbitrary evaluation.  Others can "stack", so they
// require each evaluator recursion wishing to use them must mark the limit
// used at the beginning, complete their work, and then restore the buffer's
// position to where it was.  
//
// The handling of stackable buffers became more complicated with the addition
// of features like YIELD.  That means evaluator recursions can be suspended
// and resumed at will.  So there has to be enough smarts in the code for
// hibernating a portion of the buffer (in a GC-safe location), and restoring
// it to the right "baseline" for the stack level that is being unwound, e.g.:
//
//     g: generator [yield reduce [yield "a" yield "b"]]
//
//     >> g  ; imagine DSP is 0 here
//     == "a"
//
//     >> reduce [g g]  ; REDUCE changes the DSP as it accrues values
//     == ["b" ["a" "b"]]
//
// The REDUCE inside the generator and outside the generator both need to
// have a concept of baseline, but they're also pushing values to the data
// stack.  This means that baseline must be adjusted for each call to the
// generator based on the delta in stack position between each call.  Similar
// principles apply to adjusting markers for the mold buffer and other
// nestable global state.
//

//
// * WORK IN PROGRESS: "stackless" features are adding demands to tighten up
//   the adjustment and rollback of global state.
//
// * Each evaluator stack frame currently stores a Reb_State structure in its
//   `REBFRM->baseline` field.  There are likely ways to compact and conserve
//   this information, e.g. by using a small fixed size structure that can
//   "pop out" into a dynamic structure if need be.  But, correctness first!

// !!! Experimental concept of being able to cycle through tasks.  Currently
// the only way to think of this is in terms of plugs; if a task is unplugged
// then it is necessary to plug it back in before it can run.
//
// As a first implementation, the main execution path is left plugged in so
// its stack levels are above the GO routines...this prevents having to climb
// above the console's stackful calls.  It also avoids needing to reify the
// main execution path and flush its global state.  Arguably stacks could keep
// themselves plugged in until they had to be unplugged; it could be more
// efficient, but right now each task unplugs itself when it blocks.

    // !!! Should `plug_frame` be a FRAME! value that's part of plug?  It
    // would ensure the top frame after applying is part-and-parcel of the
    // plug.  On the downside, this would force reification if it were made a
    // FRAME! value (and take up 4 platform pointers instead of 1, also).
    // As it happens, the other usage in YIELD currently forces reification
    // because it reifies the REBFRM* into state inside the yielder to pass
    // it back...this is not strictly needed.

    // !!! The idea of tasks having a channel that they send their results
    // back on is an experimental concept.  This is done so that "raw" blocks
    // can be evaluated with nothing above them on the stack and yet still
    // send the result over a channel.  The result is quoted because NULL
    // could not otherwise be sent.  It's primitive but in service to the
    // console during a primordial phase of the debugger.

// DSP and MOLD_BUF later.  Review if it's worth it to break this out
// in a different way.

// "residue"), they are just added to the array and popped off before the
